# practical-test-rescheduler
This is a tool to reschedule a practical driving test through the DVLA website. 
All you need is a twilio account, your driving licence number and your booking number. 
This uses selenium to navigate to the page on the DVLA website where you're able to select a date
on from the calender. It then extracts the available dates from the calendar and texts them to you
in an organised fashion. You can text the number if you wan't to see the closest available date or
you can send it two dates and it will text back all available dates inbetween.


This probably won't be completed as I don't particularly want to accidentally reschedule my practical,
but who knows.
